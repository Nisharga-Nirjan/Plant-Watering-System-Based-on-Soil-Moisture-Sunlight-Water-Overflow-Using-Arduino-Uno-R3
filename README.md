## Overview
In this project, we intend to build an automated plant watering system according to
the presence of sunlight and soil moisture. To detect the presence of sunlight and
moisture in soil, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and Soil Moisture Sensor will
be used. The system will read the moisture value of the soil using a soil moisture
sensor and will also read the output voltage value from the LDR. Then, according
to that, a motor will be turned on or off through a relay switch to water the plant.
Alongside that, an ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer will be used to alert the user if
there is some sort of water overflow or water clot due to an error in the system or
due to nature. Also, relevant information about the whole system regarding the
sensors and the motor will be indicated by a 16X2 I2C LCD Display. The whole
automated system will be controlled by an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller.
